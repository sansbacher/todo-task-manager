# JavaScript DOM Based Todo Task Manager

This version directly manipulates the HTML's DOM, adding/removing/editing List Items directly. There's no state saved - if you refresh the page everything is gone.

A "real" application wouldn't be written this way, but it's quick and simple to experiment and test out a basic idea.
