# JavaScript DOM Based Todo Task Manager, modified to use Bootstrap 4 (with a modal pop-up) plus Modules and Mustache Templates

This version directly manipulates the HTML's DOM, adding/removing/editing List Items directly. There's no state saved - if you refresh the page everything is gone.

This is the same as the main DOM-Based Todo Task Manager except that it is using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootstrap Native JS](https://thednp.github.io/bootstrap.native/), plus ES6 Modules, the [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) Template Library, and a nicer modal dialogue popup for the Edit Todo function. It operates the same otherwise - though Bootstrap makes it much friendlier on small mobile device screens.

A "real" application wouldn't be written this way, but it's quick and simple to experiment and test out a basic idea.

You can see a live example of it [here](https://sansbacher-task-manager.herokuapp.com/DOM-Based-Bootstrap/).
