					It seems everyone writes a Todo / Task app when learning Web/HTML/CSS/JavaScript - this is one of
					those!
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact it's
					one of three variations of the Todo / Task app. This one uses a Back-End API (written in
					NodeJS/Express/MongoDB) to save the 'state' -
					if you log in from anywhere you can access your Tasks. The page's DOM
					reflects the state saved in the MongoDB database and served up by NodeJS/Express. The Back-End
					exposes a REST API that the Front-End code accesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Back-End API is based on a <a
						href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/"
						target="_blank">NodeJS course</a>, the changes required to enable a Front-End client started
					from an
					answer from the <a
						href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/lecture/13728912#questions/7784794"
						target="_blank">Q &amp; A</a> but have been adapted, and the actual Front-End
					client is based on the LocalStorage version. Hopefully it's useful to someone else.
				</p>
				<p>
					This second version has been updated for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination. NOTE: if you set the
					Filter to only show Tasks you don't currently have, just click Refresh.<br>
					AND... there's a button on the Profile page which will add a bunch of random Mad-Lib
					style Tasks so you can test without having to tediously enter a bunch by hand!
				</p>
				<p>
					The other versions of the Todo / Task app just manipulate the DOM directly or use browser
					LocalStorage. In the first the page's DOM stores the current 'state'; the second is similar to this
					but there is no Back-End, the 'state' is saved in LocalStorage within the browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm less interested in graphic design or fancy web page aesthetics or really much of the whole
					front-end HTML/CSS than I am
					interested in the back-end API or general JavaScript. So I just wanted something that looked alright
					and would work. I picked
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/" target="_blank">W3.CSS</a> as it's free, simple, and well
					documented. I just needed
					to know enough HTML and CSS to modify the pages to work for each variation. Sorry if the page design
					isn't
					very exciting.
